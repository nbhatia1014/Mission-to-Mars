# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview:
The tools we yused Splinter to automate a web browser, BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the data, and MongoDB to hold the data that has been gathered. Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLLite, SQLALchemy to filter, and Flask, and Jupyter Notebook through VS Code. I personally posted to the GitHub repository for assistance.

After the module, Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

### Results:
This challenge was very tough for me. I was able to get everything done through the module and then the Hemisphere images as well. However, when trying to style everything, my server ran into multiple problems. I unfortunately was unable to figure out the mars hemisphere section and I am submitting because even the BCS person was unable to assist me. I am hoping that the person grading will be able to point me in the right direction.
